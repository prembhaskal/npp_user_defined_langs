# npp_user_defined_langs
user defined language in notepad++ for everyday use.

Below are the rules defined till now 

- use three right arrows ">>>" to start sentence in red.

- use hash '#' to put a sentence in green
  - use '##{' for a secondary comment with brown
  - use '###{' for a tertiary comment with blue

- use three backticks ``` <enclosed data> ```, to some code like formatting for data, inside this block other format like '#', '>>>' won't work.

See below the language in action.  (below picture does not have secondary and tertiary comments example - TODO - update this)
