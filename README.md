# npp_user_defined_langs
user defined language in notepad++ for everyday use.

Below are the rules defined till now 

- use three right arrows ">>>" to start sentence in red.

- use hash '#' to put a sentence in green

- use three backticks ``` <enclosed data> ```, to some code like formatting for data, inside this block other format like '#', '>>>' won't work.
